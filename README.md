## Notes

The biggest challenge I encountered during this project was utilizing the constraints to get the app to work at a sideways orientation. I watched multiple videos on how to properly utilize constraints but soon realized that for this project, the constraints had to be specific to my images. I did what I could but was unable to get it exactly right. I will need to work more in the future in order to understand how constraints work because this project was rather straight forward for me in every aspect except constraints, which added 4 hours to this project on its own.
